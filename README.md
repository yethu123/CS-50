## [Algorithms](https://docs.cs50.net/2017/fall/notes/0/lecture0.html#algorithms)

-   Now that we know how to represent inputs and outputs, we can work on algorithms, which is just step-by-step instructions on how to solve a problem.
#lecture1(c programming)
 
   float y = get_float("y: ");

    // Perform division
    printf("%f divided by %f is %f\n", x, y, x / y);
    

#lecture2(C)
1. preprocessing
- In C, preprocessing involves replacing the lines that start with #include with the contents of the actual file.
2. compiling
 - The compiler takes the complete source code and converts it to assembly code, much simpler instructions that look like this:
      

       main: #   @main
          .cfi_startproc
       # BB#0:
           pushq   %rbp

 3. assembling
  -  Finally, these lines of assembly are converted to 0s and 1s that the CPU can directly understand.
  4. linking
 -  We also need to combine into our program the binary file for standard I/O library that we call functions from, and this last step does exactly that. Recall that we only included stdio.h, which is just the header file that declares the functions, not the actual code for them
      - eprintf, to provide information to ourselves when our program is running:
      - Typecasting is casting, or converting, variables from a certain type, like int, to another, like char, or vice versa.

   1.Searching
  **linear search**
     
for each element in array
    if element you're looking for
        return true
return false

 **binary search**
 look at middle of sorted array
if element you're looking for
    return true
else if element is to left
    search left half of array
else if element is to right
    search right half of array
else
    return false


2.Sorting
 1. insertion sort
 2. Bubble sort
 3. selection sort
 -    Insertion sort
for i from 1 to n-1
   call 0'th through i-1'th elements the "sorted side"
   remove i'th element
   insert it into sorted side in order


-   Bubble sort
repeat until no swaps
   for i from 0 to n-2
       if i'th and i+1'th elements out of order
           swap them

-   Selection sort
for i from 0 to n-1
   find smallest element between i'th and n-1'th
   swap smallest with i'th element
